Nineteenth week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description

The goal of this project was to add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

* The user can enter deposits or expenses offline.

* When the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit while offline, then that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.

## Built With

* Javascript
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
